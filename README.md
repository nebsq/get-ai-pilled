# Get AI-Pilled

Inspired by Aparna Chennapragada's episode on Lenny's Podcast.

- Get AI-Pilled is a minimal, open-source Chrome extension that replaces your new tab page with a simple reminder: **"How can you use AI to do what you're going to do right now?"** 

- It provides quick links to popular AI tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Grok, T3 Chat, and Perplexity, encouraging you to leverage AI for productivity and creativity before starting any task.
